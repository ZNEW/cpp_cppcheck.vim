This plugin will let you run Cppcheck on the C++ code in the current window. Errors from Cppcheck are presented in the quickfix window so you can edit - check - edit. Just use the command :Cppcheck. After installing the plugin, use :help cpp_cppcheck in Vim for details, including how to set command line options for Cppcheck.

I've tested this with Vim 7.4 on Linux (Kubuntu 15.04). Other platforms and versions of Vim should work, but I can't be sure.
